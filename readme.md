### Running the Server

To run the server on port 4000, use the following command:
```
node src/server.js
```

### GraphiQL

This project uses GraphiQL, an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and testing GraphQL queries. Once the server is running, you can access GraphiQL by navigating to the server URL in your browser.
